# Interactive To-Do List with Full CRUD Functionality

This project is a simple, interactive to-do list application with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. It allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring that the list persists even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Click the checkbox next to a task to mark it as completed.
- **Edit Tasks**: Click the "Edit" button to modify an existing task.
- **Delete Tasks**: Click the "Delete" button to remove a task from the list.
- **Persist Data**: All tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so your list is retained even after a page refresh.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three main files:

- **index.html**: Contains the structure of the webpage.
- **styles.css**: Handles the styling of the webpage, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.
- **script.js**: Contains the JavaScript code responsible for the application's functionality.
